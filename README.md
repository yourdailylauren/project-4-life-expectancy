# project-4-life-expectancy

Team names:
- Lauren Pescarus
- Liana Hamacher
- Michael Krebs
- Mitchell Brian

Synopsis:
We are using data on life expectency provided from Data.gov as joined with county specific demographic data and the longitude and latitude details for each county to break down the models further. We hope to use this data to predict the life expectancy based on various details as shown in the data file. We will use a neural network machine learning model to make our preditions and will further explore the data via Tableau to showcase the findings. Our presentations will be shared in a slide deck hosted on Google Slides.  

Data Resources:
- US county lat and lon data: https://simplemaps.com/data/us-counties
- Census data: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-life-expectancy-at-birth-by-state-and-census-tract-2010-2015
- County demographics data: https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/county_demographics/

We are trying to learn if the life expectency rate increases based on a few key details:
- If income influences the life expectency
- If education influences the life expectency
    - do they have a bachelor degree or not?
- If race influences the life expectency
- If population density impacts life expentency?
